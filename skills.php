                <h2>Full-Stack Development</h2>
                <p>
                  I have devoted the last year-and-a-half to learning full-stack
                  development. After having picked up the basics of HTML, CSS
                  and JavaScript, I moved onto in-depth learning of the Ruby
                  programming language and the Ruby on Rails framework. Currently,
                  I develop backend services in Go or Kotlin and use React, Vue
                  and Flutter for the frontend. I am further expanding my skills
                  by learning about distributed systems, microservies,
                  Kubernetes and other cloud tools.

                <h2>Time Management & Organisation</h2>
                <p>
                  For me one of the most important factors in career success are
                  good time management and organisation skills. For this reason,
                  I carefully plan each day, week and month of the year, to
                  ensure that I am staying on track to come closer to my goals.
                  The book that helped me learn this and make it become my
                  routine is "Eat That Frog!" by Brain Tracy.

                <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
                <p>
                  Every software developer knows, that their role requires
                  problem solving skills. I too enjoy this activity. For this
                  reason I enjoy learning algorithms and data structures,
                  and solving various coding challenges as they give me tools to
                  tackle problems faced during development, as well as allowing me
                  to model a real-life problem to something I've encountered
                  before.

                <h2>Eagerness to learn new things</h2>
                <p>
                  I have discovered that I find it enjoyable adapting to new
                  situations, which require learning new things. I love a good
                  challenge. I am constantly strive to expanding my knowledge
                  skills. The things I am currently learning include: software
                  design, programming languages and tools such as Go, Kotlin and
                  Kubernetes, as well as the soft skills e.g. mastering the
                  art of communication.
